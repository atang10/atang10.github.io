# WebsiteTemplate1
**This is easiest to read in raw mode or in a text editor bc I suck at GitHub formatting.. sorry
**Option 1 of a design for a personal website.. easy to customize and use!!

This template is to be used for creation of a personal website, geared towards engineering students. It includes a home page with space for a brief introduction about yourself, activities section, and technical skills, as well as a page for projects, resume and links to different forms of contact (LinkedIn, GitHub, Email). 

HOW TO USE:

1. Follow initial directions regarding setting up a personal website using GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/)
2. Clone this repository into your GitHub Pages repository and onto your computer to somewhere you can find it. 
3. Take a look through the website -- all of the pictures on it are currently stock photos and the resume is an example resume. Change all of these to be personal to you. There are comments throughout each file that tell you exactly what to change. 
4. Be creative, play around with formats and styling, and remember -- google is your friend!! Anything you don't know how to do, you can probably find on google. 
5. TEST YOUR WEBSITE -- click all links to make sure they work, resize the page to see how it looks in different shapes, just play around with it until you're sure everything works and looks the way you want it to

index.html -- homepage, intro, activities, technical skills (lines might be a little off if I make changes to the code and forget to update.. just look around nearby for the comments if it's not exact..)
